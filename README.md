### The use of Could, Would and Can.

Could, would, and can are all modal verbs and they can be difficult to master. Let's look at each one separately, and then compare some of their more confusing uses.

### Could

Could, can, and would can be confusing in English. Editor Kory Stamper gives an explanation of how they are used.

Can has many uses as a modal verb, but there are three uses that can be confusing to an English learner. These are: when can is used to describe ability ("I can change the oil in my car without help."), ask for permission ("Can I go to the movies tonight?"), or say whether something is possible or not ("Do you think he can win the race?"). Can is also used to suggest something might happen in the future ("If you finish your homework, we can go to the movies.").

Can, like could and would, is used to ask a polite question, but can is only used to ask permission to do or say something like ("Can I borrow your car?" "Can I get you something to drink?").

Could is the past tense of can, but it also has uses apart from that--and that is where the confusion lies. When could is used as the past tense of can, it refers to an ability that a person generally had in the past or to something that was generally possible in the past ("When I was younger, I could run for miles," or "It used to be you could buy lunch for a dollar.").

Like can, could can be used of possibility as well, but the connotation is slightly different. In the sentence "We can have as many as ten people for dinner tonight," can is used to show ability ("We are able to have as many as ten people for dinner tonight;" “We have enough food/space for ten people.”).

By contrast, when could is used in this way, it refers to something that you believe is likely to be true or to happen. In the sentence "We could have as many as ten people come to dinner tonight," could is used to say that it is possible that ten people will come to the speaker’s home for dinner ("I think that it is possible we will have as many as ten people for dinner tonight.").

Could is also used to refer to something that you wish to have or do but that is not possible ("If only we could be free of this tyrant!"). It’s also used to describe something that was possible but did not happen, used with the verb have ("We could have won if we had practiced harder."). Could can also express annoyance or another strong emotion ("He could have asked me if I needed help!" or "I could have died I was so embarrassed!"), but can isn’t used this way.

When making general polite suggestions or asking a question, both could and can are possible ("Excuse me, can/could you tell me what time it is?").

Would is a little easier to understand because it is not related to could or can, and its uses are more specific. Would is used to talk about a possible situation that has not happened or that you are imagining ("I would quit my job if I won the lottery."), and it is also used with have to describe a situation that could have happened but did not ("She would have eaten less if she had known there was going to be dessert.").

Like could, would is used to describe something that you think is likely to be true or likely to happen ("I think the meal would [=could] feed ten people." "He said he would help me with this set of exercises when he gets home.").

Would can also be used to ask polite questions ("Would you mind if I had another cup of tea?"), or to wish for something ("I wish she would write a book."). It has several distinct uses that can and could do not, however: it is used to give opinions ("I wouldn't do that if I were you," or "I would say that she is in her 30s. [=it is my opinion that she is between 30 and 39 years old]"); it is used to express a willingness to do something ("I would be happy to take her to the airport"); and it is used to express frustration with something that you believe a person always does ("Well, he would say that, wouldn't he?  He always says that!"). 

```
I can do it # Yo puedo hacerlo.
You can do it # Tu puedes hacerlo.
It can do it # Ello puede hacerlo.
He can do it # El puede hacerlo.
She can do it # Ella puede hacerlo.
We can do it # Nosotros podemos hacerlo.
They can do it # Ellos pueden hacerlo.

Examples: 
I can speak English and not only I can do it. You can also do it if you study a lot. 
# Yo puedo hablar Ingles, y no solo yo puedo hacerlo. Tu tambien puedes hacerlo si estudias mucho.

I can play the guitar, but I can't sing. 
# Yo puedo tocar la guitarra, pero no puedo cantar.



She can do it too # Ella tambien puede hacerlo.
They can do it very well # Ellos pueden hacerlo muy bien.

```

### Using could

```
I could do it # Yo pude hacerlo.
I could not do it # Yo no pude hacerlo.

I could not do much for her 
# Yo no pude hacer mucho.

I couldn't do much if you were not not here. 

# Yo no podria hacer mucho si tu no estuvieras aqui.
I could do this... -> Yo podria hacer esto..
if I could... -> Si yo pudira...
I could do a lot of things if I had... -> Yo podria hacer un monton de cosas si you tuviera...
```

### Modal Verbs:

Modal verbs: "may," "might," "can," "could," and "ought"
Question
Modal verbs: "may," "might," "can," "could," and "ought"
Answer
A reader asked for some guidance on using the modal verbs "may," "might," "can," "could," and "ought." Editor Emily Brewster responds:

The entries for each of these include the complete definitions, as well as many example sentences, so I will discuss here only the aspects of each that I think are likely to cause confusion.

These verbs are all modal verbs, which means that they are generally used in combination with other verbs, and are used to change the verb's meaning to something different from simple fact. Modals express possibility, ability, prediction, permission, and necessity.

"Ought" is probably the simplest of this set of modal verbs. It's almost always followed by "to" and the infinitive form of a verb. It means the same thing as "should," and is used in the same ways, although "ought" is less common and a bit more formal. A few examples of "ought" are "We ought to be home by noon," which means "I expect that we will be home by noon," and "I ought to fix that," which means "I should fix that."

"May," "might," and "could" can all be used to say that something is possible, as in "The story may/might/could be true" or "The painting may/might/could be very old." You can use any of the three in contexts like these.

"May" and "might" can both be used to say that one thing is true but that something else is also true, as in "This car may/might be more expensive than the other cars, but it will be cheaper to maintain." (If we used "could" instead of "may" or "might" here the sentence would mean that it is not certain that the car is more expensive than the other cars.)

Both "may" and "can" are used to indicate that something is allowed, but "may" is more formal: "You may leave whenever you like" is more formal than "You can go whenever you want to." Children are often taught that only "may" is used for permission, and that "can" is used only for ability. (For example, a child may ask a question like "Can I go outside?" and the responding adult might correct the child by saying that the child is able to go outside, but must ask permission by using "may.") "Can," however, is often used for permission.

"Can," "may," and "could" are all used to make requests. "May" is formal in these contexts, while "can" and "could" appear mainly in speech: "May I have your attention?" is more formal than "Can I have your attention?" or "Could I have your attention?"

Making matters even more confusing, I think, is that two of the modal verbs we're discussing are, aside from being modal verbs in their own rights, the past tense forms of two of the others: "might" can be used as the past tense of "may," and "could" is the past tense of "can." "Might" functions as the past tense of "may" mostly in formal contexts, as in "Generously, the senator inquired as to whether she might be of any help to us." "(The usual way of expressing past tense with "may" is "may" followed by "have" and a past participle. The sentence "It may take longer than they expect it to," becomes "It may have taken longer than they expected it to.") "Could" is the usual past tense of "can": "We could see the ocean from the window of the cabin." (see also the usage note at "can")
