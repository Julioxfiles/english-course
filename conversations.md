When you want to say someone has
assumed you are the right person you can say that's me. In this conversation you said "Are you Kayla ?" and I said "That's me".

This is just an afirming and a positive way that they have the correct person or in this case the correct ubber driver.

If you want to tell someone that they souuld get into yoir car you can say "Jump in". When you say "Jump in", you say come into the car. This is slang (jerga) actually to say come into the car, jump in.

A lot of times you'll hear  American English speakers taltk in the future tense. And instead of saying "where you going", they'll say "where you headed" if you say
we're headed to the mall it means

Wouldn't if feel great to be able to just sit down at the piano anytime you want and play the worship songs you love ?

Or to have the confidence and skill to play the piano or keyboard on your worship team at church ?

How about leading worship from the piano ?

But belive it or not, all these things are finally possible, even if you've never played the piano before in your life.

Hi, my name is Jared Messer, and I've created a system that allows anyone to learn to play worship piano like a pro.

It doesn't matther how much experience, sill, or musical ability you currently have.

And it doesn't take years to master. You can be up and creating professional sounding music on the piano in a matter of days.

Now you may be thinging "Yeah, right". But it's true. It's already working for students off all differente skill levels and backgrounds all arround the world.

Let me explain how it works. Learning to play the piano, the traditional way can take years. It's day after day and week after week of working on scales, excercises, note reading and practice.
But what if instead of all that you only focused on the things you needed to know to play worship piano.

Then what if you took those few complicated skills and broke them down into even smaller steps, steps that were simple to learn and easy to play ?

From there, you could (podrias) combine these steps together and you'd be playing. That's exactly what I did.

You see, as a professional musician I began to see patterns in the way pros played. The patterns weren't overly complicated but sounded fantastic.

Based on those patterns I created somehing called Worship Piano Skill Sets. And this is really what makes it possible to learn to play so quickly.

Ever heard the saying that "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step" ? Well, learning to play piano can seem like that kind of journey. Very far off and seemingly impossible to reach.  But from the moment you start using Worship Piano Skills Sets, you understand why they dramatically shorten the time and effort it takes you to get you there. But even more than just getting you there quickly. You'll get professional sounding reaults at the same time. Now, we had a piano training course our site already called Worship Paiano: Begginer to Pro. And the response to that was fantastic !. 

People like Messon JJ said "The very best! I will go over and over watching this course. I believe without doubt, my worship piano playing will tremendously improve".

Or Steaven "I've already started playing songs I thought I would never get. I have studied notes but never chords and have never been instructed in chords. This is so great !.

Erika who said: "This course was the best investment I could have made and am so glad I found it. Jared presentd and distilled music concepts in away that was so easy to emplement.

But even with all the great results we were seeing, I knew we could still give more.So I thought, What if I took the strongest parts of Worship Piano:Beginner to Pro and combined them with the Worship Piano Skill sets ? So thats what I did. 

We kept all the best elements of that highly rated course, added in the Worship Piano Skill Sets, but then we massivley expanded it even farther by adding a ton of other stuff!. And since it grew out of the original course we called the system: Worship Piano Beginner to Pro 2.0

This is the combination of decades of learning, teaching and playing. Without a doubt, it's the ultimate worship piano learing system. Let me tell you about everything we've included in Worship Piano: Beginner to Pro 2.0

First, the Worship Piano Skill Sets, each of the 4 skill sets has tow parts. Learn and Practice. In the learn section you'll watch sort videos showing you exactly what to do this skill in a particular key and then in the practice section you perform that skill and to make it easy for you , you coud see all the practice videos.

And the practice seession use something I like to call "song style", which means they feel more like songs than practices.

So if you wre thinking this was filled with boring, monotonoues exercises, think again. These practices are fun.

The idea is that each Skill Set is developing in you a different element of playing worship piano. Kind of like targeting specific muscles in a workout to maximize your fitness.

We do that with each of the 4 Skill Sets. Let me tell you about them. The first one is something I call "One the five", thinker independence in the right hand is crucial for playing melodies and runs. And then wonderful skill sets make it easier to do both. You see, in worsing music any time you play a melody or play a note its almost always in the right hand, that why define a skill set focuses mainly on the right hand. The 1 to 5 Skill Set helps you learn the notes of the scale much faster. But it also develops your finger playing speed, precision, and dexterity. 

The 2nd Worship Piano Skill Set is ERH which stands for "Easy Right Hand". ERH is a skill set add much more, it's also something I descovered many years ago. With it, you can play just any worship song with the same pattern over and over butit sound amazing and very prefessionall.

I've used ERH in live performances, studio work and leading worship.It always creates a rich, modern contemporary worship sound, and it's brain dead simple.

I taught my 10 year old daughter the basics of the ERH Skill Set. She used it to play piano along with me on vocals and guiter for a family funeral. I played the artist recording for her a few times and we had just 3 rehearsals. But she killed it. Playing it prefectly.

People couldn't belive it when I told them she'd only heard the song for the first time just 3 days before. And I know it'll work just as well for you. And after you progress throught the Practices in more than one key
all the keys are included. You'll be able to sit down in any setting, with just about any song. And almost INSTANLTLY be able to play along like a pro. It's really crazy. 

The 3rd Skill Set is ELM which stands for "Easy Left Hand". When playing conteporary worship music it's not easy to know what to do with your left hand. Especially when you might only have a chord chart or lead sheet to follow. I realized at one point that I use a very simple formation in my left hand.
And I use it almost all the time. It changes a little but basically the same thing over and over.

Let's now to say that something plays or sound bad, quite the opposite, its the same thing yuo'll hear in those recordings. I wnat you to learn and practice the ELH Skill Set and see for yourself how easy it is, and then you'll know what exactly play in the left hand.

Back in high scool I stumbled on something. There was a pop song I learned to play
